# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in improving the Confidential Transfers SDK. This repository holds two
packages, versioned separately since 2.1.0:

- **TypeScript** (repository root) — `@softseco/confidential-transfers`
- **Rust** (`rust/`) — `softseco-confidential-transfers`

## Prerequisites

- **Node ≥ 20.18** and npm (for the TypeScript package)
- **Rust** (stable) with `rustfmt` and `clippy` (for the crate)
- For on-chain and browser tests: the Solana CLI with `solana-test-validator` from **Agave 4.x**
  (see [On-chain tests](#on-chain-tests))

## TypeScript

```bash
npm install
npm run typecheck        # tsc --noEmit, for src/, examples/ and the browser test
npm run build            # Node build, browser build (dist/browser) and type declarations
npm test                 # unit tests; on-chain tests are skipped without a validator
npm run coverage         # unit tests with coverage
npm run example:devnet   # full round trip on devnet, paid from your Solana CLI wallet
npm run docs:api         # regenerate the API reference in docs/api (TypeDoc)
```

### On-chain tests

The confidential-transfer instructions need a local validator from Agave 4.x (older releases
reject the proofs `@solana/zk-sdk` makes today) and a Token-2022 build that matches the
`@solana-program/token-2022` client. That build is in `test/fixtures/` (see its README):

```bash
# 1. start the validator with that Token-2022 (leave running)
TOKEN_2022_SO=test/fixtures/spl_token_2022.so npm run validator

# 2. run the integration tests against it
CT_LOCAL_PROGRAM=1 npm test
```

Without `CT_LOCAL_PROGRAM=1`, on-chain tests are skipped and only unit tests run.

### Browser test

`test/browser/e2e.ts` runs the Vite example in Chromium with a Wallet Standard test wallet against
the same validator. With the validator running:

```bash
npm run build
(cd examples/vite && npm ci && VITE_RPC_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8899 VITE_CHAIN=solana:localnet npx vite build)
npx playwright-core install chromium      # once; or set CHROMIUM_PATH to a Chrome you have
npm run test:browser
```

On failure it saves a screenshot in `test/browser/artifacts/`.

## Rust

```bash
cd rust
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo build
cargo test          # unit tests
```

Dependencies are pinned with `=` to the exact set the official `spl-token-cli` uses, because the
Solana crate ecosystem is mid-migration (3.x → 4.x) and newer patches pull conflicting majors.
Keep `Cargo.lock` committed and in sync when changing dependencies.

## Pull requests

- Open an issue first for anything larger than a small fix, so we can align on the approach.
- Keep the two packages in parity where possible: a change to a helper's behavior should land in
  both TS and Rust, or explain why not. Known gaps today: the Rust crate has no `withdraw` and does
  not resolve transfer-hook accounts.
- Before pushing: unit tests pass, `tsc` is clean, and (for Rust) `fmt`/`clippy` are clean. CI runs
  all of these.
- Update [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) under an `Unreleased` heading, and the docs if you change
  the public API. For a release, set `gitRevision` in `typedoc.json` to the new tag and run
  `npm run docs:api`.
- Keep commits focused and messages descriptive.
